That's a script to remove all the kernel package and the signature package except the newest by the main version :                                                  Ex.(if 5.5 all 5.5 kernel except the last one.)
Work also for 5.6 kernel versions.
Yeah that's how waste time.
It works but idk it report error with if statement, just ignore them.
